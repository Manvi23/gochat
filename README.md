## Serverless cacheless chat room 

The idea is to play with Golang and push it's boundaries. Here, we build a 
binary that simulates a chatroom! 

* Everyone who has this binary running on their machines, effectively starts their own chat room!
* Start the binary using `gochat -name "Gautam's Chat Room" -port 12345`
* It broadcasts on port 33333 to update any new chatroom about it's existance. Effectively, this is also a health check
* It listens on the port mentioned in the cmd line for any incoming requests for chatting.
* All communication is via gRPC so that we are very sure about the structure of the messages exchanges.
* Channels and Go-routines should be used to manage each chatroom for public and private messaging!
* Changes to proto can be generated by protoc -I api/ -I${GOPATH}/src --go_out=plugins=grpc:api api/api.proto
Innovate over this idea!
